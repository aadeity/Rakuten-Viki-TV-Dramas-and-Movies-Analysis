# Rakuten-Viki-TV-Dramas-and-Movies-Analysis

🎯 Objective & Business Problem

Business Context

Rakuten Viki is a global streaming platform focused on Asian content — especially Korean, Chinese, Japanese, and Taiwanese dramas and movies. As competition in streaming intensifies, Viki needs to invest in content that maximizes engagement, subscriber growth, and regional expansion.

However, their catalog has:

Thousands of titles from multiple countries

Many genres and formats (weekly dramas, variety shows, films)

Mixed quality and popularity (not every show is a hit)

Limited visibility into which combinations of country + genre + format + rating actually drive success

Core Business Problem

“How should Rakuten Viki prioritize licensing and original content investments across countries, genres, and formats to maximize platform growth, given limited budget and rapidly shifting audience preferences?”

Specifically, Viki’s leadership needs to know:

Is the supply of Korean vs Chinese vs other Asian content growing or saturating?

Which countries and genres are rising, and which are flat or declining?

How do ratings and popularity vary by country, genre, runtime, and age certification?

Which actors and directors consistently appear in top-performing titles?

Where are the content gaps – genres or regions with strong demand but limited supply?

This project turns the raw Viki metadata into actionable content strategy insights.
